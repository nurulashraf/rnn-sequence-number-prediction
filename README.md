# Predicting Sequence Number using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

A simple RNN model that predicts the next number in a sequence. This project demonstrates data preparation, model architecture, training, and inference using Python, TensorFlow/Keras.

## Project Structure

## Features

- Generates sequential numeric data for training and validation
- Builds a Recurrent Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trains the model to predict the next number in a sequence
- Supports sequence inference post-training

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for building and training the RNN  
- **NumPy**, **pandas** (optional) – for data manipulation
